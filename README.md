# clj-dice-roller

Extremely simple Clojure library that rolls a set of dice for you. This is simply an example of using [transcriptor][] to test a code base.

Check out the `dice-roller.core` namespace for more information.

You can run the transcriptor repls with `lein repls`.

The post for this repository can be found on [my blog][].
